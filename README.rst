`qiskit <https://qiskit.org/documentation/>`_ is an open-source compilation framework capable of targeting various
types of hardware and a high-performance quantum computer simulator with emulation capabilities and various
compiler plug-ins.

This library implements so far one quantum machine learning classifier which has been introduced by F.Petruccione,
M. Schuld and M. Fingerhuth (http://stacks.iop.org/0295-5075/119/i=6/a=60002). Athough this is the only classifier
implemented so far, this library is to be used as a repository for more classifiers using qiskit as a background
framework.


Features
========

* Distance & Majority based Hadamard-gate classifier

    * Generic real valued vector space input data (slow)

    * Binary valued vector space input data (faster)

    * Feature map pre-processing for non-linear classification

Installation
============

This library requires Python version 3.5 and above, as well as qiskit.
Installation of this library, as well as all dependencies, can be done using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m pip install dc_qiskit_aqml

To test that the algorithms are working correctly you can run

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make test

Getting started
===============

You can check out the classifier as follows

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, Normalizer
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

    import qiskit

    from dc_qiskit_qml.feature_maps import NormedAmplitudeEncoding
    from dc_qiskit_qml.distance_based.hadamard import QmlHadamardNeighborClassifier
    from dc_qiskit_qml.distance_based.hadamard.state import QmlGenericStateCircuitBuilder
    from dc_qiskit_qml.distance_based.hadamard.state.sparsevector import MöttönenStatePreparation

    X, y = load_iris(True)
    # Only the first two features and only get two labels
    # This is a toy example!
    X = np.asarray([x[0:2] for x, yy in zip(X, y) if yy != 2])
    y = np.asarray([yy for x, yy in zip(X, y) if yy != 2])

    preprocessing_pipeline = Pipeline([
        ('scaler',  StandardScaler()),
        ('l2norm', Normalizer(norm='l2', copy=True))
    ])
    X = preprocessing_pipeline.fit_transform(X, y)

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.10)

    # Using the generic wave function (state vector) routine using the 'Möttönen'
    # state preparation algorithm
    initial_state_builder = QmlGenericStateCircuitBuilder(MöttönenStatePreparation())

    # The normed amplitude encoding ensures that the data is normalized
    # This is a somewhat unnecessary step as above we do that already
    feature_map = NormedAmplitudeEncoding()

    execution_backend: BaseBackend = qiskit.Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
    qml = QmlHadamardNeighborClassifier(backend=execution_backend,
                                        shots=8192,
                                        classifier_circuit_factory=initial_state_builder,
                                        feature_map=feature_map)

    qml.fit(X_train, y_train)
    prediction = qml.predict(X_test)

    "Test Accuracy: {}".format(
        sum([1 if p == t else 0 for p, t in zip(prediction, y_test)])/len(prediction)
    )

    prediction_train = qml.predict(X_train)
    "Train Accuracy: {}".format(
        sum([1 if p == t else 0 for p, t in zip(prediction_train, y_train)])/len(prediction_train)
    )

The details are a bit more involved as to how this works and the classifier can be configured with a circuit factory
or a feature map.
