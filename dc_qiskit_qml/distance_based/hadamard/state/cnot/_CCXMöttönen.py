.. currentmodule:: dc_qiskit_qml.distance_based.hadamard.state.cnot._CCXMöttönen

This module implements a :py:class:`CCXFactory` to create a multi-controlled X-gate (or NOT gate) to a circuit
using the uniform rotations as described by Möttönen et al. (http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2011670.2011675).
